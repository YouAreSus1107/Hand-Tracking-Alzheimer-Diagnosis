"""
Build the static, publicly hostable copy of the dashboard.

    python tools/build_web.py        ->  web-build/

launcher_web/ is normally served by launcher.py, which also answers /api/*,
serves /assets/ and serves the local-only research doc at /analysis. A static
host does none of that, so this script assembles a build that:

  * copies launcher_web/ to the web root and assets/ to /assets/
  * injects tools/web_static/static-api.js, which bridges /api/* to the hub
    running on the visitor's own machine and falls back to a preview when
    there is none (see that file)
  * runs tools/build_release.py, which puts the downloadable setup bundle in
    web-build/download/
  * rewrites the footer, which links to /analysis -- a docs/ file that is
    deliberately never published

Nothing from results/ or docs/ is copied. Deploy with:

    firebase deploy --only hosting

Stdlib only, matching launcher.py and install.py.
