/*
 * glove.ino - analog acquisition for the sensor-glove digital twin
 *
 * Implements the analog front end and serial protocol specified in
 * docs/glove/GLOVE_FIRMWARE_PLAN.md (sections 3 and 4).
 *
 * Current hardware (2026-09-26, the last direct-wired prototype before the
 * perfboard, the A401 palm pads and the mux): two FSR402 pads - p0 on A0
 * (thumb tip), p1 on A1 (index tip) - and four flex strips, thumb -> ring:
 * f0 on A2, f1 on A3, f2 on A6, f3 on A7. A4/A5 are left unconnected. Every
 * sensor is soldered, and each is its own divider against the 3V3 rail:
 *     3V3 --- SENSOR --- Ax --- rFixed --- GND
 * The pads use 10k; the strips use 47k. That is why rFixed is per
 * channel in CHANNELS[] rather than one global: a divider is most sensitive
 * where rFixed is near the sensor's own resistance, and a flex strip
 * (~10k flat to ~110k bent) sits in a very different band from an FSR
 * (1-30k in its rated range). Adding the remaining sensors, and the
 * CD74HC4067 mux, is a table edit rather than a rewrite.
 *
 * The onboard IMU (gate 5) rides in the same frame as six extra columns. It is
 * NOT an analog channel: it never touches the divider maths, and its columns
 * are declared in the banner with kinds `accel`/`gyro` so the host cannot apply
 * a resistance curve to an acceleration.
 *
 * Firmware emits RAW counts only - ADC counts for the analog channels, and
 * integer milli-units for the IMU. Conversion to newtons and degrees is a
 * per-user host-side step (plan section 2) so recalibration never needs a
 * reflash. The one exception is the 'D' diagnostic mode, which prints derived
 * millivolts/ohms for bench work and never touches the data frames.

 * ADC_FULLSCALE_MV is the ADC *reference* (what a reading of ADC_MAX means).
 * VDIV_SUPPLY_MV is the rail feeding the top of the divider.
 * On a Nano 33 BLE these are both 3.3 V. On a classic 5 V Nano the reference
 * is 5 V while the divider is fed from the 3V3 pin, so they differ - which is
 * exactly why they are two separate constants.

 *
 * PIN LAYOUT (fw 0.8.0): force pads first, then flex strips, each group in
 * finger order thumb -> ring, skipping A4/A5. The old even-pins-for-force
 * convention was dropped with this build; the mux replaces direct pins next.
 * Nothing enforces a layout either way, because
 * every channel names its own pin in the table below and the host reads the

 * rule the code checks. Adding the next sensor is one line here plus a flash;

 *
 * ONLY DECLARE PINS THAT ARE PHYSICALLY FITTED. An unconnected analog pin
 * floats and produces convincing-looking garbage rather than an obvious zero.

 * rFixed MUST MATCH THE RESISTOR PHYSICALLY ON THE BOARD, per channel. This is

 * plausible number. If you swap a physical resistor, change it here in the
 * same breath.
 *
 * 10k on an FSR402 centres on a moderate press, deliberately kept: plan 5b
 * weighed lowering it and rejected it, because the resolution gained sits
 * above the part's rated 20 N and costs light-touch resolution. 47k on the
