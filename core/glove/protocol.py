"""Sensor-glove wire protocol — pure parsing, no I/O.

Implements the frame and banner format specified in
``docs/GLOVE_FIRMWARE_PLAN.md`` §4 and emitted by ``firmware/glove/glove.ino``.

Everything here is deliberately hardware-free and total: no function raises on
malformed input, they return ``None`` instead. A glove on a USB cable produces
truncated lines whenever a read straddles a frame boundary, so "returns None"
is the normal path, not an error path.

Unit-tested in ``screening_tests/tests/test_glove.py``.
